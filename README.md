# Login-with-Toast
this is a simple login app, which toast's the username prefixed by "hello".
the username takes the input.
the password field doesnt saves anything. its just there for show.
main purpose is to customise the toast.

i know its very basic and requires some debugging and needs to be a bit more attractive. 
i will make the necessary changes and will update soon.
thanks for reading
